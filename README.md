# RoadMap.sh-Clone
This repository contains a basic clone of RoadMap.sh(for now) , it doesn't contain the entire complexity of Roadmap.sh. The project is still under construction.
For now you can only edit and create a Mindmap , the viewing part is still to be made.
How to Use -> create a react app folder and install the dependencies and simply replace everything in the src folder with the src folder in this repo.
Dependencies -> ReactJs , Node Js , React Flow (the newer version of react flow), React Redux
